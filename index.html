          <p class="pp">They speak too quickly, so sometimes it seems like they skip important parts or don't explain everything correctly;</p>

            <h4 class="tt">Consequences</h4>
          <p class="pp">The series talks a lot about how money works, but it says little about the problems it brings, such as inequality, corruption, etc.</p>

        <div class="coluna quatro centralizado">
            <h4 class="tt">Perspective</h4>
          <p class="pp">They interview experts, but they don't show different opinions. This makes it seem like everyone thinks the same way, but there are many discussions and different viewpoints on money and economics. It would be good if they also included other perspectives.</p>

                <p>"Explained...Money" is a Netflix series. It's all about money, from how it originated way back when to how it's used nowadays. Each episode focuses on a different aspect of money and explains it in an easy-to-understand manner. They use interviews with people who know a lot about economics and even cartoons to help explain the ideas.</p>
                <p>The cool thing is that it shows how money influences our lives in various ways, like what we buy and even what the government does. But sometimes it feels like they skip over some important parts or don't explain everything properly; they talk really fast, so sometimes it's hard to keep up.</p>
                <p>Still, it's a cool series for anyone who wants to understand more about money and how it works worldwide. We learn how to make better decisions and get to know more about how the whole world operates.</p>
